# Anki LLM Generator

## Approaches

Could use OSS model and ChatGPT

Could use RAG Architecture

Could read in all Anki docs for vector database

Could download all Anki decks and use them as a corpus

Could use a pretrained model and fine tune it on Anki decks

Could use a pretrained model and fine tune it on Anki docs

I think it would be good to compare the best OSS LLAMA model against ChatGPT 4 Turbo.

ChatGPT 4 Turbo should be able to produce good Anki cards

Using LLAMA should prove even more so the cost effectiveness of a tool of this caliber
